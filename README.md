# Opticraft

Opticraft a complete guide for an optimized 1.12.2 modded experience

## First Thing First

Let's define precisely what is an optimization mod:

It improves the game by either improving performance (making it faster) or making it more ressource efficient (using less of your CPU/GPU/etc.).

But it needs to do so without removing a feature or making said feature worse or in the case of making the game more ressource efficient it needs to do so without reducing performance.

## Why?

Because Minecraft is badly optimized so for the best experience, we need a plethora of mods which is changing.

Also, I made this since all the other guides are either uncomplete or filled with mods that are useless or that makes the performance worse.
